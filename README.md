🌾 Smart Crop Yield Prediction using Rain Water Trapping & Machine Learning

This project combines a classic DSA problem (Trapping Rain Water) with Machine Learning to enhance crop yield prediction.
The trapped rainwater is computed from elevation data and used as a feature in a Decision Tree Regression model to predict agricultural yield.

Project Overview :-

DSA Concept Used: Trapping Rain Water (Two Pointer Technique)
Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree Regressor
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
The idea is to simulate how terrain elevation affects water retention, which in turn influences crop yield.
